-----
Before going to discuss we must know about Java.

-----> Java is a Programming Language.
-----> Developed by SunMicroSystem Comapny.
-----> Now oracle Comapany acquired SunMicroSystem.
-----> Now Java is under the License of Oracle Company.
-----> Java is High Level - Programmming Lanaguage.
-----> Java Program files will have .java extension.
	Ex: demo.java, login.java
-----> Java Programs should be converted into machine understandale format to execute.
-----> Java Programs we cant execute directly (.java files)
-----> We need to compile java source code into byte code using Java Compiler.
	Ex: javac demo.java, javac login.java
-----> When we compile java source code it will converted into .class file
-----> We need to execute .class file to run our java program
	Ex: java demo
-----> When you run a java program, JVM will start and it will execute java program.
	JVM-----> Java Virtual Machine
-----> JVM will convert byte code into machine understandable code.

-----> Java Project contains several java programs.
-----> We need to compile project source code into byte code, when compile the project 	source code we will get .class files.
-----> To deploy Java Project, we will package all .class files as JAR/WAR files.


--> Standalone java projects will be packaged as JAR file.
--> Web Application will be packaged as WAR file.

	JAR ---> JAVA ARCHIEVE
	WAR ---> WEB ARCHIEVE


-> When Java Project Complied as following 

     	        compile			               packaged
.java files   ===========>>>  .class files        ================>  JAR/ WAR file  ====> Deployed in to Server
(Java Project)               (Once compiled it       [ By maven]
		              generate the byte 
			      code as .class files)

=====
NOTE
=====

 **** Java Source code is not possible to deploy on the server directly ****
 **** Java Project contains number of java files it is not possible to compile at a time ****
 *** So Maven Tool comes to picture, java Project source code is packaged as JAR/WAR file ***
  ** By using this JAR/WAR files we can deployed on the Server and accessed by the User**
