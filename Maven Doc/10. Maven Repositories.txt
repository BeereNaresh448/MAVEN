----->Maven local repository keeps our projects all dependencies (library jars, plugin etc.
-----> When run maven build, the maven automatically downloads all the dependency jars into
	local repository.

Location of the Local repository:

	C:\Users\user\.m2

2. Central Repository:
------------------------

----> If a project requires any dependencies first maven looks the local repository,
      if it is not available then go to Central Repository/remote repository based on         configuration and download, it will be added to Projcet build path.
