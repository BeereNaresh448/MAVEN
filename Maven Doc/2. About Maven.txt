What we can do using Maven?
---------------------------

---> By using Maven, we can create initial project Folder Structure.
---> We can download "Project Dependencies" using maven.
	Ex: spring boot, hibernate, kafka, redis, email, log4j, junit etc
---> To develop one java project we will use several frameworks like              
	 spring,hibernate etc along with java.
---> We need to download those frameworks and we should add to our project.
---> These frameworks are used in our project are called as "Dependencies"
---> Instead of we are downloading dependencies, we can tell to maven      
	software download that dependencies.

NOTE: Required dependencies will be added in ""pom.xml"" file in maven software it will download them.
